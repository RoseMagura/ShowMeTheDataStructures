# Problem Two Explanation

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), because it uses some
single-layered for loops. There is only one list, which holds a small
number of entries, so the space complexity is also low. 

I chose to use a loop to go through the different files and directories
in a simple way for better readability. I also used the enter_dir function
to keep the different parts streamlined and simple.
